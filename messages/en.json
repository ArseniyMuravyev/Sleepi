  "Consistency": {
    "main": "Consistency is one of the most important things about sleep. It can lower the risk of death by up to 40%! If you can only improve one aspect of sleep, let it be consistency. Matthew Walker, author of the world bestseller \"Why We Sleep?\", says: \"Regularity is king! And when you anchor your sleep [to a specific time], you will improve both the quantity and quality of that sleep.\""
  },
  "Temperature": {
    "main": "Cooler temperatures promote the release of melatonin, a sleep hormone. Sleep Foundations say: \"The best room temperature for sleep is approximately 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius). This may vary by a few degrees from person to person, but most doctors recommend keeping the thermostat set between 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 to 20 degrees Celsius) for the most comfortable sleep.\" For better sleep you can also take a hot shower before sleep. Why? Because your body temperature will go up with the shower, and then drop later, in your chilled-out bedroom"
  },
  "Light": {
    "main": "Our ancestors slept in pitch darkness in a cave. We must do our best to recreate this process. This is actually important for our sleep. This will help you wake up less during sleep, get deeper sleep, reduce eye strain and even reduce the likelihood of getting cancer! I highly recommend using blackout curtains, or a sleep mask. It will be a great investment in your sleep."
  },
  "Caffeine": {
    "main": "Caffeine consumption can make you fall asleep after, sleepless hours overall, and make your sleep feel less satisfying. Dr. Dustin Cotliar, Sleep Physician, says: \"Even though caffeine makes you feel energized, it’s important for people to understand that it doesn’t replace a good night’s rest.\" The time required for just half of the total caffeine to be eliminated from the body, known as the half-life, is anywhere from 2 to 12 hours. I recommend you a simple rule that will improve your sleep. Don't drink coffee in the afternoon. Or you can try decaf coffee."
  },
  "Alcohol": {
    "main": "There is a myth that a bit of alcohol improves your sleep. Alcohol leads to shorter sleep duration and a poorer quality of sleep. Therefore, in an ideal world, you should not drink alcohol at all. It's extremely hard, but it's one of the best gifts you can make for a healthy sleep and for overall health. So I recommend you do your best to not drink alcohol."
  },
  "Association": {
    "main": "Your brain always find associations. You need to teach your brain to associate your bed only with sleep. Nowadays you can do almost everything in your bed: work, chat, order food etc. But it's really important to use your bed only for one thing - sleep. After your brain will learn that the only thing you need to do in your bed is sleeping you will fall asleep much faster."
