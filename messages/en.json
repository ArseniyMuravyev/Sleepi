  "Consistency": {
    "main": "Consistency is one of the most important things about sleep. It can lower the risk of death by up to 40%! If you can only improve one aspect of sleep, let it be consistency. Matthew Walker, author of the world bestseller \"Why We Sleep?\", says: \"Regularity is king! And when you anchor your sleep [to a specific time], you will improve both the quantity and quality of that sleep.\" If for some reason you haven't been able to go to bed on time, it's best to wake up anyway according to your sleep schedule. Let's say you decide to go to bed at 23:00 and wake up at 7:00. One day it turns out that you come home only at one o'clock in the morning. The best solution in such a situation is to wake up at the scheduled time. Yes, during the next day you will feel tired, sleepy and tense. But you will definitely fall asleep at night, and also keep your routine, which is extremely important for a healthy sleep. I strongly recommend going to bed at the same time, even on weekends. Trying to sleep it off over the weekend almost always does more harm than good. A person cannot eat or get drunk for the week ahead, just as he cannot sleep for the week ahead. Take care of your sleep regime!"
  },
  "Duration": {
    "main": "So how much sleep do you actually need? Here is a quote from National Library of Medicine site, \"7 to 8 h of sleep per day was most favourably associated with health.\" But it's not that easy. The required length of sleep depends on a huge number of factors, from age to emotional state. There is no magic number at which every person would ideally get enough sleep. Everything is very personal. In fact, there are people who only need 4-5 hours of sleep to feel great. Although there are only a few of them, they still exist. And there are people who need 10 or even 12 hours of sleep to really get enough sleep. Because of this, the magic number 8 appeared, which is supposedly the ideal sleep duration. On my own, I can only advise you to experiment. Observe your condition after 7-8 hours of sleep. Ask yourself, \"Do I feel rested in the morning? Do I have enough energy during the day?\". If the answer is no, then most likely you need more sleep. But again, your well-being may depend on other factors: a psychoemotional state or illness. The final advice is: experiment!"
  },
  "Temperature": {
    "main": "Cooler temperatures promote the release of melatonin, a sleep hormone. Sleep Foundations say: \"The best room temperature for sleep is approximately 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius). This may vary by a few degrees from person to person, but most doctors recommend keeping the thermostat set between 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 to 20 degrees Celsius) for the most comfortable sleep.\" To improve the quality of sleep, I recommend that you get warm pajamas, and try to make the room where you sleep colder. If this is not possible, then basic ventilation of the room before going to bed will make your sleep better and deeper."
  },
  "Light": {
    "main": "Our ancestors slept in pitch darkness in a cave. We must do our best to recreate this process. This is actually important for our sleep. This will help you wake up less during sleep, get deeper sleep, reduce eye strain and even reduce the likelihood of getting cancer! I highly recommend using blackout curtains, or a sleep mask. It will be a great investment in your sleep. Light also plays a huge role in awakening. There are such alarm clocks (can be found on the Internet on request \"Light alarm clock\"), which gradually become brighter and brighter by the specified time, and you wake up in the room as if you had the light on. A very interesting thing, especially helps in winter, when it is still very dark in the morning and it is especially difficult to get up. Another tip: try to spend time in the sun in the first hours after waking up (this works even if the sun is completely covered by clouds. The brightness of the secondary light ranges from 200 to 120,000 lux. For comparison, the brightness of a conventional lamp is 100-140 lux. If you wake up before sunrise, try to turn on the maximum amount of artificial light in the house). This helps to adjust circadian rhythms and gives a signal to the whole body about waking up. For the same reason, about an hour before bedtime, it is recommended to minimize light (including blue light from phones and other devices). To sum up, in the morning try to get as much light as possible, preferably sunlight, an hour before going to bed, start turning off the light in the room, and before going to bed, remove all possible light sources."
  },
  "Caffeine": {
    "main": "Caffeine consumption can make you fall asleep after, sleepless hours overall, and make your sleep feel less satisfying. Dr. Dustin Cotliar, Sleep Physician, says: \"Even though caffeine makes you feel energized, it’s important for people to understand that it doesn’t replace a good night’s rest.\" The time required for just half of the total caffeine to be eliminated from the body, known as the half-life, is anywhere from 2 to 12 hours. I recommend you a simple rule that will improve your sleep: do not consume foods containing large amounts of caffeine in the afternoon.",
    "title": "Caffeine - ",
    "definition": "is a substance found in coffee, right? Not exactly. Yes, caffeine is an alkaloid compound which is found especially in coffee plants and is a stimulant of the central nervous system. But caffeine is found not only in coffee, but also in: cocoa, many types of tea, Coca-Cola and even milk chocolate"
  },
  "Alcohol": {
    "main": "There is a myth that a bit of alcohol improves your sleep. Alcohol leads to shorter sleep duration and a poorer quality of sleep. Therefore, in an ideal world, you should not drink alcohol at all. It's extremely hard, but it's one of the best gifts you can make for a healthy sleep and for overall health. So I recommend you do your best to not drink alcohol."
  },
  "Association": {
    "main": "Your brain always find associations. You need to teach your brain to associate your bed only with sleep. Nowadays you can do almost everything in your bed: work, chat, order food etc. But it's really important to use your bed only for one thing - sleep. After your brain will learn that the only thing you need to do in your bed is sleeping you will fall asleep much faster."

    "definition": "A scale of temperature on which water freezes at 32° and boils at 212° under standard conditions. To convert to the usual degrees Celsius, you need to: subtract 32 from the original number, multiply it by 5 and divide by 9. For example, the value 341°F corresponds to (341-32)*5/9 ≈ 171.66°C"
  },
  "Phases": {
    "title": "Stages of sleep - ",
    "definition": "is an oscillation between the NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid eye movement) phases of sleep. During REM sleep, brain activity picks up, nearing levels seen when you are awake. At the same time, the body experiences atonia, which is a temporary paralysis of the muscles, with two exceptions: the eyes and the muscles that control breathing. Even though the eyes are closed, they can be seen moving quickly, which is how this stage gets its name. REM sleep is believed to be essential to cognitive functions like memory, learning, and creativity. REM sleep is known for the most vivid dreams, which is explained by the significant uptick in brain activity. The deep sleep phase is divided into 3 more phases, but such details are still unnecessary. During deep sleep, your breathing, muscle activity, heartbeat, and brain waves slow down. Unlike the REM sleep phase, during deep sleep, eye movements slow down. A very important detail: waking up after REM sleep is much easier than after deep sleep. If you wake up after a long sleep as if you were run over by a bulldozer, most likely you woke up in a deep sleep phase. Below are recommendations on how to avoid this.",
    "main": "As it was said, for better well-being, you need to wake up during the REM sleep phase. But how to do it? Nowadays, there are a huge number of devices that help you track sleep phases and wake up at the most optimal time. In fact, they are all far from ideal. For a long time, I used a special watch to track sleep, which showed the \"sleep rating\" in the morning. But very often in the morning I felt terrible, and the clock showed a great rating. Or vice versa - I felt great, and the clock showed a rating below average. After that, I subconsciously start to feel worse. I tell myself, \"Yes, it looks like I really didn't get enough sleep,\" even if it's not true. In general, there is no real solution at the moment. But I found a very good, as it seems to me, application for the phone - Sleep Cycle. This is a smart alarm clock that wakes you up not at a specific time, but at a selected interval. For example, if you need to get up at 8 a.m., he can wake you up in the time interval from 7:30 to 8:00. Again, this is not an ideal solution. There is also a sleep rating, which does not always reflect reality. But I found this solution to be optimal at the moment.",
    "post": "P.S. The application has basic, free functionality (which in my opinion is quite enough) and a paid subscription. I've been using the free one all the time."
  },
  "About": {
    "main": "We've all heard that you need to sleep for 8 hours to get enough sleep. This is partly true, partly a myth. Most likely, everyone has come across the fact that after a long sleep you still feel tired and drowsy. Sleepi is made to help you cope with this problem. Here are the best recommendations for improving the quality of sleep, because it plays a huge role in your well-being after waking up. I can guarantee that if you follow the tips given below, your sleep will improve many times, as well as your well-being."
