  "Consistency": {
    "main": "Regularity is one of the most important qualities of sleep. Matthew Walker, author of the world bestseller \"Why are we sleeping?\", writes: \"The main thing is regularity! When you tie your sleep to a certain time, you improve both its quantity and its quality.\" It is recommended to go to bed at the same time, even on weekends. Trying to sleep it off over the weekend almost always does more harm than good. A person cannot eat or get drunk for the week ahead, just as he cannot sleep for the week ahead. Take care of your sleep routine!"
  },
  "Duration": {
    "main": "How much do you really need to sleep? Here is a quote from the website of the National Library of Medicine: \"Sleep lasting from 7 to 8 hours a day is most favorably associated with health.\" But it's not that simple. The required length of sleep depends on a huge number of factors, from age to emotional state. There is no magic number at which every person would get enough sleep perfectly. For some, 5-6 hours is enough to get enough sleep, while others need 9-10. Try to conduct a series of experiments, gradually adjusting the duration of sleep to find the best option for yourself. This is the best way to figure out exactly how much you need first."
  },
  "Temperature": {
    "main": "Lower temperatures promote the release of melatonin. Sleep experts say: \"The best room temperature for sleeping is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius). This indicator may differ by several degrees for different people, but most doctors recommend maintaining a temperature in the range of 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 to 20 degrees Celsius) for the most comfortable sleep.\" To improve the quality of sleep, it is recommended to get warm pajamas, and try to make the room where you sleep colder. If this is not possible, then basic ventilation of the room before going to bed will make your sleep better and deeper."
  },
  "Light": {
    "main": "Light is extremely important for quality sleep. Minimizing the light in your bedroom will help you wake up less at night, sleep more soundly and reduce eye strain. It is recommended to use blackout curtains and a sleep mask. There are alarm clocks (they can be found on request \"light alarm clock\") that gradually increase the brightness of the light by the time you wake up, simulating a natural dawn. This is especially useful in winter, when it is dark in the morning and getting up becomes more difficult. Another tip: try to spend time in the sun in the first hours after waking up (this works even if the sun is completely covered by clouds. The brightness of the secondary light ranges from 200 to 120,000 lux. For comparison, the brightness of a conventional lamp is 100-140 lux). Sunlight in the morning helps to adjust circadian rhythms and gives a signal to the whole body about waking up."
  },
  "Caffeine": {
    "main": "The time it takes to eliminate only half of the total amount of caffeine from the body, known as the half-life, is from 2 to 12 hours. There are people who say that caffeine has no effect on them and does not cheer them up at all. But even if you don't feel a surge of energy after a cup of coffee, caffeine still affects your body, and your sleep becomes less deep and high-quality. There is a simple rule that can improve your sleep: do not consume foods containing large amounts of caffeine in the afternoon.",
    "title": "Caffeine - ",
    "definition": "it is an alkaloid compound found, in particular, in coffee plants and is a stimulant of the central nervous system. Caffeine is found not only in coffee, but also in cocoa, many types of tea, Coca-Cola and even milk chocolate."
  },
  "Alcohol": {
    "main": "Alcohol in any quantity shortens the duration of sleep, worsens its quality and disrupts circadian rhythms. Dr. Abhinav Singh, an expert in sleep medicine, noted in his research: \"Alcohol and sleep are incompatible — they have a bad effect on each other.\" Excessive alcohol consumption can cause insomnia. Therefore, ideally, alcohol should be completely excluded. This is one of the best contributions you can make to your overall health and to improve your sleep quality."
  },
  "Circadian": {
    "title": "Circadian rythms - ",
    "definition": "are biological cycles that regulate various processes in the body, including sleep, wakefulness, hormonal secretions, body temperature and other physiological functions. These rhythms follow a 24-hour cycle and are synchronized with external factors such as light and temperature, although they exist in the absence of external signals. In the context of sleep, circadian rhythms play an important role in determining when we feel awake or tired. The main regulator of circadian rhythms is the hypothalamus in the brain, which is responsible for the production of melatonin. Disruption of circadian rhythms, for example, due to jet lag, night work, or an irregular sleep schedule, can lead to insomnia, fatigue, and other health problems."
  },
  "Melatonin": {
    "title": "Melatonin - ",
    "definition": "is a \"sleep hormone\", a regulator of the circadian rhythm of all living organisms. When it gets dark outside, melatonin levels rise and we begin to feel sleepy. In the morning, with the advent of light, the production of melatonin decreases, which helps to wake up. Quite often melatonin is used in the form of additives. This approach is not recommended by sleep scientists, since constant intake of melatonin can lead to the body ceasing to properly regulate its production on its own. This can worsen sleep problems in the long run."
  },
  "Fahrenheit": {
    "title": "Fahrenheit - ",
    "definition": "is the temperature scale according to which water freezes at 32 °C and boils at 212°C under standard conditions. To convert to the usual degrees Celsius, you need to: subtract 32 from the original number, multiply by 5 and divide by 9. For example, the value of 100°F corresponds to (100-32)*5/9 ≈ 37.78 °C."
  },
  "Phases": {
    "title": "Stages of sleep - ",
    "definition": "is an oscillation between the NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid eye movement) phases of sleep. During REM sleep, brain activity picks up, nearing levels seen when you are awake. At the same time, the body experiences atonia, which is a temporary paralysis of the muscles, with two exceptions: the eyes and the muscles that control breathing. Even though the eyes are closed, they can be seen moving quickly, which is how this stage gets its name. REM sleep is believed to be essential to cognitive functions like memory, learning, and creativity. REM sleep is known for the most vivid dreams, which is explained by the significant uptick in brain activity. The deep sleep phase is divided into 3 more phases, but such details are still unnecessary. During deep sleep, your breathing, muscle activity, heartbeat, and brain waves slow down. Unlike the REM sleep phase, during deep sleep, eye movements slow down. A very important detail: waking up after REM sleep is much easier than after deep sleep. If you wake up after a long sleep as if you were run over by a bulldozer, most likely you woke up in a deep sleep phase. Below are recommendations on how to avoid this.",
    "main": "As it was said, for better well-being, you need to wake up during the REM sleep phase. But how to do it? Nowadays, there are a huge number of devices and alarm clock applications that help you track sleep phases and wake up at the most optimal time. In fact, they are all far from ideal. Almost all such devices have a kind of \"sleep rating\", which evaluates how you slept at night according to various indicators. Unfortunately, very often this rating does not correspond to reality. There are also sleep phase calculators that allow you to choose the desired time to wake up, and then calculate the optimal time to go to bed so that your body has time to go through several full sleep cycles. You can easily find such a calculator by typing \"sleep calculator\" or simply \"sleep calculator\" into the search bar."

  },
  "Nap": {
    "main": "Many prominent personalities, such as Winston Churchill, Salvador Dali, Thomas Edison, Napoleon, Albert Einstein and even Aristotle, practiced daytime sleep. Such a list indicates the possible benefits of this habit. The main thing in such a dream is its duration and time of day. If it lasts for more than 30 minutes, then most likely you will wake up in a deep sleep phase. Therefore, the ideal duration of such a sleep is 15-30 minutes. In such a short time, your body will be able to rest and reboot. As for the time of day: it is best to sleep in this format after lunch. A later time can damage your basic sleep."
